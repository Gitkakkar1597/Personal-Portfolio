## **Usage**
### **Toggling Modes:**

- The mode toggle functionality is managed by the `toggleMode` function in `script.js`, which dynamically loads the respective CSS file.

### **Navigation:**
- The navigation bar is fully responsive. On smaller screens, the menu will collapse into a hamburger menu.
- The active section in view is highlighted in the navigation menu as you scroll.

### **Contact Form:**
- The contact form uses EmailJS to handle submissions. Fill out the form and click "Send" to contact me directly via email.
